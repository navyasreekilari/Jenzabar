Introduction to Interactions:
An interaction is any type of communication with or about an individual or organization in J1 web.
* Categorized in J1 web as documents, emails, notes, notifications, phone calls, texts, and To Dos.
* Once defined, can be grouped into sets.
* Can be reused
* Sent/applied interactions are associated with recipients records in J1 web.
Use cases:
--> Standard Interactions
* Used for communication orginating from J1 communications.
* Serve as templates that can be reused
* Can be grouped and ordered in a repeatable set.
--> Communication drawer
* Used when creating communications throughout the system
   - A user clicks an option to send a communication and the Create new communication drawer appears. Communication drawer interactions your school defines appear as interaction code options that can be associated 
     with their communication.
--> Recording Purposes Only Interactions
* Used for recording communications that happened outside of the system 
   - Can copy communications from an external source and apply them to records
* Do not serve as templates.
--> System Events
* Originate from the system and are sent when a selected event occurs in J1 web as opposed to being based on a schedule.
* Future releases will continue to provide additional system event options.


> Interactions:
* Limit who can see the communication
* Include a reporting reference on what has been communicated to whom 
* Provide a general overview of the topic of converation

> While interction codes are unique, the codes are not used to determine the uniqueness for statistical purposes.
* Interactions can change as settings are updated
* Every time the interaction is used, an interaction history is created to allow analysis of that interaction configuration at the time it was used.
* Future release will include reporting dashboards within J1 web.

Interaction Access Codes: are loosely based on Desktop's module code stamp and control who can work with or view different interactions based on the roles they belong to.
* Registrars Grant roles access to interaction codes. Users in the role can work with interactions associated with those codes.
* Associate codes with interactions during the define process.
* Each user can set up their primary acces in the General Settings section.
* Access codes can be associated with any rle in J1 web.
* Each role can have multiple access codes.
* Communications administrator/IT is responsible for associating access codes to the system roles and ensuring the appropriate users are assigned to them.
* As interactions are defined, the communication administrator will be responsible for associating access codes with that interaction which will grant user access to the communicaitons.

Custom Interaction Access Codes:
* Jenzabr-provided interaction access codes are available. These access codes are based on Jenzabar modules and mirror modules. Code stamps currently available in the Desktop, Notepad.
* Each interaction can have multiple interaction access codes.
 - These codes are used for security only; other data is used for reporting.

> We can create our own custom access codes.
> Grant access to your codes via roles.
> Codes are associated with interactions when they are defined/created.

My General settings:
> Commmunication administrators have the option to select a default access code that can e used every time they create an interaction.
They can select a code that aligns with their primary office.
1. Select your profile icon in the top right and choose "My General Settings".
2. From Communication preferences, select the "default Interaction access code". This will be used with every interaction you create but can be changed if needed.

Best Practices:
> Try to use meaningful interaction names
> Reuse interactions when possible.
> Avoid changing interaction definitions.
> User Interaction Owner code to identify the department responsible for the communication.
>User Interaction Access codes to control who can see your communication.
> Define generic interactions for each department for easy communication.

Email Interactions:
Click on Communication Management hub and go to Define interaction tab.
There, you can create your own Interaction.

Document Interactions:
> Generates personalized word documents that can be printed and mailed to your constituents.
> J1 communications uses a third-party tool that provides word file generation without needing to maintain a microsoft office installation on your J1 web server.
> Create the word template.
> To build a document interaction, complete the basics and data merge option steps of the wizard.
  * Identify the merge data set you plan to use to personalize the communication.
Word templates:
In word document write your own letter template and save it as .dtx.
Next on Jenzabar go into Interaction and select type as "document", give all the fields select the saved documnet in the word and submit.

Note Interactions:
Go to interactions page: In interaction use (Standard interaction or communication drawer or Internal recording purposes only)
Select data fields query like first_name, Last_nameor any fields necessary.

Notification Interactions:
> Notifications are pop-up alerts that appear when recipients are logged into the system. They can also be viewed from the J1 web notification center.
> Alert users about point-in-time information they need to be aware of but aren't important for long-term storage.
> Notifications can be generated by the system or created as interactions.
> Notifications can be sent via J1 web and the campus portal. Students, faculty and employees that are not J1 web users see a pop-up in their active web browser even when they are not actively using the campus portal.

Text Interactions:
> go into Interaction : Select all required fields , Interaction Use( Standard interaction). In template content fill all required fields and finish the interaction. Lastly, in type select "Text" type interaction.

To Do Interaction:
> Same as above select new interaction and fill all require fields, Interaction Use( communication drawer) and finish the interaction.
