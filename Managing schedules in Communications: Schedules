Best Practices
*Colloborate with different areas on campus
*Evaluate communication to identify when it is best to use calendar-driven or term-driven schedules.
*Automate interaction runs.

Schedules
Schedules are associated with interaction sets and determine when the first communication in a set will be sent. When the set kicks off,
the system starts evaluating who will receive the different interactions.
* Schedules can be recurring
* The next time the schedule starts, the interaction set will kick off and reevaluate any recipient criteria to ensure only those recepients 
that still meet the crteria receive the interaction.
* Schedules let you "set it and forget it"
* Sets can also use a Kickoff Date instead of selecting a recurring schedule.

Creating and Monitoring schedules
Under communication hub we have schedules which are in Inactive and active status.
We can create schedule by entering your requirements  in "Create schedule" tab.
